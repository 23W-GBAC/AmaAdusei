# Dealing with change
Hi, my name is Ama and I would be writing a blog on, 'Dealing with Change' based on personal experiences.
I hope you are inspired, follow my blog!
## What is Change?
I collected the views of people on,'Change.'
Change is inevitable. Change is uncomfortable. Change is painful.Change can be scary. Change is ugly but change is beautiful...
Everyone seems to have the similar reactions towrds change.
Change is the order of the day. Change is a movement from one point to another; be it progressive or retrogressive. Change happens a lot. it is mostly trival and without impact (Trival Change is barely noticed), like when you changed your style of dressing since you grew older. Change is mandatory, as we grow everyday, we change. Growth comes with change. It would be abnormal to see an adult having a fit in public to get a person's attention. Change should be embraced as a constant in life. It is # inevitable. The effects of change can manifest in various ways; be it physically, mentally,emotionally, socially, just to mention a few but for this blog, we would be diving into the mental(psychological) manifestation of change and maybe a little bit on the emotions. (pyschology and emotions are cousins)

I took these pictures in the beautiful land of Pfarrkirchen during the fall. I know you would be wondering what these trees have got to do with "Change". (See how one whole tree is without a single leaf) Watch me explain this and my inspiration in the video below.

# In The Midst Of Change.
So why did I post pictures of trees during the fall? You would realize that during the fall trees lose almost all, if not all their leaves. Yes, and they become bare and ugly and all their once beautiful leaves would just be brown, crusty munchy things on the floor and we would just be stepping on them as we walk and. That is a period of change because that is not the natural state of the tree at that moment. A tree has leaves and it has been known to have leaves. It knows it has leaves. Then there comes a period where all the leaves go down and they are bare and they are ugly. I don't know. I'm sure if trees were to talk, nothing would make sense to them, but you realise that the fall is just for a season. Other seasons will come and eventually their leaves will grow back again and they will be very beautiful again, serving their purpose again, be it should to give shade or to help the human respiratory process. But for the moment,that is during the fall, they lose everything. They lose all their leaves, but you don't see a tree breaking down. I wanted to use the trees during the fall, as a sort of encouragement that no condition is permanent, no matter what you are going through, it's a season. It has to happen. Fall has to come, the leaves have to fall, and new leaves eventually come, and they are beautiful once again. So change is a constant, yes, but it is for a period.
Then you would ask, ## what do I do in a process of change?# ##What do I do when there's a major change or a minor change going on?#
The first step, as we've already established, is for you to accept that change is inevitable, that change has to occur, change would come, it doesn't need your permission. Now I want you to understand that change comes with pain. Be it a good change, be it a change you are anticipating, no matter what you are anticipating, it comes with change. I wanted to travel outside my home country so bad. I wanted to try new things. I wanted to have a fulfilled life and do a lot of things.
And I'm a Christian, so I would said through the help of God, I see those things unraveling. I see everything working out for me, but I still go through pain because it's a season of change. I'm not with my family, I'm at a place where I know no one, I've left all my friends and I'm here trying to figure out life. It's a good change, but it comes with pain. It comes with a lot of pain. Change comes with pain, and accepting the pain and dealing with it is one way to protect your mental health. You have to be calm and know that this is not the end, but a period and know how to deal with it.This is because the pain that comes to change can even cause you to let down your principles. But no, someone told me you do not let down your principles no matter what, unless it's to help you, you do not let down your personal principles.
