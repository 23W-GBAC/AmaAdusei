# Dealing with change
Hi, my name is Ama and I would be writing a blog on, 'Dealing with Change' based on personal experiences.
I hope you are inspired, follow my blog!
## What is Change?
I collected the views of people on,'Change.'
Change is inevitable. Change is uncomfortable. Change is painful.Change can be scary. Change is ugly but change is beautiful...
Everyone seems to have the similar reactions towrds change.
Change is the order of the day. Change is a movement from one point to another; be it progressive or retrogressive. Change happens a lot. it is mostly trival and without impact (Trival Change is barely noticed), like when you changed your style of dressing since you grew older. Change is mandatory, as we grow everyday, we change. Growth comes with change. It would be abnormal to see an adult having a fit in public to get a person's attention. Change should be embraced as a constant in life. It is # inevitable. The effects of change can manifest in various ways; be it physically, mentally,emotionally, socially, just to mention a few but for this blog, we would be diving into the mental(psychological) manifestation of change and maybe a little bit on the emotions. (pyschology and emotions are cousins)

I took these pictures in the beautiful land of Pfarrkirchen during the fall. I know you would be wondering what these trees have got to do with "Change". Watch me explain this and my inspiration in the video below.
