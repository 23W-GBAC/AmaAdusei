# Dealing with change
Hi, my name is Ama and I would be writing a blog on, 'Dealing with Change' based on personal experiences.
I hope you are inspired, follow my blog!
## What is Change?
I collected the views of people on,'Change.'
Change is inevitable. 
Change is uncomfortable. 
Change is painful.
Change can be scary. 
Change is ugly but change is beautiful...
Everyone seems to have the similar reactions towrds change.
An anonymous contibutor wrote;
"To me change is moving from one state to another, whether good or bad
It may happen suddenly or occur gradually 
Sometimes it's intentional but other times due to the present happenings it must occur 
I won't say change it bad, as much as it can be very unpleasant and uncomfortable it's not bad in itself
Change is one tool to new beginnings but most people don't like it because it can be difficult to deal with when you are not ready 
In my experience, I had been in a particular place for far too long and I wanted to move, I just wanted to leave that place. I was happy when the place we used to  live got changed, with this one it's a good one 
But when I had to start school at the uni, I had never lived all alone before, and I was wondering how I would cope with everything, it was quite challenging but with time I was very ohk and I liked it 
So change as challenging and difficult as it may be, with time becomes a wonderful experience"
