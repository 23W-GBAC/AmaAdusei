# AUTOMATION PROJECT BLOG
AUTOMATING DAILY MOTIVATIONAL AND INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES FOR MENTAL HEALTH.

I wrote a blog based on dealing with change as change can be hard on the mental health of an individual. So I thought it wise to automate a process whereby inspirational and motivational quotes would be generated on a daily to inspire the readers not to give up. This would be tiresome so me to do on a daily. I might even forget on somedays, hence the automation. 
For my automation project, I decided to use a simple python script with Virtual Code Studio and later uploaded into my github files.
