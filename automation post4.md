# WEEK FOUR; COMMENTS AND OVERALL IMPRESSION 
I shed a lot of tears and had a lot of migranes during this process.

Three times I caught myself nearly  saying,"ScheiÃŸe." To even decide on the automation project was tough.
After I knew what to do, the problem was not the code but the execution of the code. Before, I had no idea of what I was doing and I made so many errors. I even created a workflow file without having a corresponding Python Script.ðŸ˜¹
I also made some radical decisions as well as silly ones. I created so many branches and some forks(which I deleted after) to test every step I made towards the automation project. This helped me to keep the mess from my main branch until I was sure of the progress. Once, I did feel lazy to work on a branch and I messed upn my main branch (I did cry) but before that i had previously copied all the files on my GitHub repo twice on my local machine and my phone alsoðŸ˜¹ so I deleted everything and copied it back.
I also sought advice from 'Stack Overflow' and 'Python Reddit' everytime I got an error with my workflow and they were indeed helpful.
In some months to come after gaining more insight, I look forward to making advancements.
I am open to any advice and adjustments. I am looking for ways to make the automation even better and I can not do that without your honest views, comments and contributions. Thank you.
