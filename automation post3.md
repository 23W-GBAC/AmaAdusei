# WEEK THREE; SETTING UP THE WORKFLOW
(with this particular task, I failed two times before it worked the third time when i was just clicking things on GitHubðŸ˜‚)
To set up the workflow for the script on GitHub, I went to the 'Actions' which led me to my workflows then I went to 'New workflow' and went on to set up a workflow for myself.  This action created a '.github workflow' folder with a 'yml' file embedded in it. Again, this workflow file is visible on my GitHub repo as, '.github/workflows.'
I then put in a code in the file which would run my Python quote_generator.py script every five minutes. After making the commit, I had to wait for the moment of truth. (It was so scaryðŸ˜‚.)
